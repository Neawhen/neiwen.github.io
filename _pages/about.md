Neiwen Ling is currently a Postdoctoral Associate in the Efficient Computing Lab at Yale, workingÂ under the guidance of <a href="https://www.linzhong.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Lin Zhong</a>. She completed her Ph.D.(2022) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of <a href="https://staff.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~glxing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Guoliang Xing</a>. 

Her research interests lie at the intersection of Edge Computing, Machine Learning, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)/Internet of Things (IoT), and Real-time Systems, with a focus on developing **time-sensitive AI systems** (e.g., DL, FM, LLM) for **embodied agents**. 
These systems have broad applications, including **autonomous driving, embodied AI, and smart cities**.

- Systems for LLM, Time-Sensitive LLM in CPS ( <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18695" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> TimelyLLM </a>,  <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.14950" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> TypeFly </a>) 
- DL on CPU-GPU Edge Platforms, Time-Sensitive DL ( <a href="https://neawhen.github.io/neiwen.github.io/assets/pdf/blastnet_sensys2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> BlastNet </a>,  <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3485730.3485938" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> RT-mDL </a>)
- Distributed DL, Cooperative Edge Computing (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3636534.3649352" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Soar </a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3583120.3586955" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> CoEdge </a>)

She has published papers at several ACM/IEEE flagship conferences (e.g., SenSys, MobiCom, MobiSys, IPSN, and IoTDI), and received the ACM SenSys 2022 **Best Paper Award Finalist**, the ACM MobiCom 2024 **Best Artifact Award Runner-Up**, and the ACM SenSys 2022 **Best Poster Award**. She served as the program committee member for several ACM/IEEE flagship conferences, including SenSys25, ICPADS24 and CHASE23.
