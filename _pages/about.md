Neiwen Ling is currently a Postdoctoral Associate in the Efficient Computing Lab at Yale, working with <a href="https://www.linzhong.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Lin Zhong</a>. She completed her Ph.D.(2022) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of <a href="https://staff.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~glxing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Guoliang Xing</a>. 

Her research interests lie at the intersection of Edge Computing, Machine Learning, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and Real-time Systems. She focuses on advancing ***time-sensitive AI systems***, with an emphasis on designing AI (i.e, DL, FM, LLM) systems for <b>embodied agents</b> such as robots, assistive devices, and autonomous vehicles. These systems have wide-ranging applications, including <b>autonomous driving, embodied AI, and smart cities</b>.

She has published papers at several ACM/IEEE flagship conferences (e.g., SenSys, MobiCom, IPSN, MobiSys, and IoTDI), and received the ACM SenSys 2022 <b>Best Paper Award Finalist</b> and the ACM SenSys 2022 <b>Best Poster Award</b>. She serves as the program committee member for several ACM/IEEE flagship journals/conferences, including SenSys25, ICPADS24 and CHASE23.
