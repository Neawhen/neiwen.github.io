I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in <a href="http://aiot.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AIoT Lab</a> at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, advised by <a href="https://staff.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~glxing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Professor Guoliang Xing</a>. 
I also work closely with <a href="https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~nanguan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Nan Guan</a> and <a href="https://yanzhenyu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Zhenyu Yan</a>.
My research interests include Edge AI, concurrent deep learning, real-time deep learning, and new approaches to on-device deep learning.

I completed my Ph.D.(2022) in Information Engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, where I was advised by <a href="https://staff.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~glxing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Professor Guoliang Xing</a> and worked on real-time AI. Before, I received my Bachelor's degree (2018) in Electronic and Information Engineering from Northwestern Polytechnical University.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
