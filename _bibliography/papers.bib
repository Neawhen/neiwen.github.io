  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract = {In recent years, Deep Neural Network (DNN) has been increasingly adopted by a wide range of time-critical applications running on 
  edge platforms with heterogeneous multiprocessors. To meet the stringent timing requirements of these applications, heterogeneous 
  CPU and GPU resources must be efficiently utilized for the inference of multiple DNN models. Such a cross-processor real-time 
  DNN inference paradigm poses major challenges due to the inherent performance imbalance among different processors and the lack 
  of real-time support for cross-processor inference from existing deep learning frameworks. In this work, we propose a new system 
  named BlastNet that exploits duo-block - a new model inference abstraction to support highly efficient cross-processor real-time DNN 
  inference. Each duo-block has a dual model structure, enabling efficient fine-grained inference alternatively across different processors. BlastNet employs a novel block-level Neural Architecture 
  Search (NAS) technique to generate duo-blocks, which accounts for computing characteristics and communication overhead. The duoblocks are optimized at design time and then dynamically scheduled 
  to achieve high resource utilization of heterogeneous CPU and GPU at runtime. BlastNet is implemented on an indoor autonomous driving platform and three popular edge platforms. Extensive results 
  show that BlastNet achieves 35.07 % less deadline missing rate with a mere 1.63% of model accuracy loss.},

  author={Ling, Neiwen and Wang, Kai and He, Yuze and Xing, Guoliang and Xie, Daqi},
  abstract={Recent years have witnessed an emerging class of real-time applications, e.g., autonomous driving, in which resource-constrained edge platforms need to execute a set of real-time mixed Deep Learning (DL) tasks concurrently. Such an application paradigm poses major challenges due to the huge compute workload of deep neural network models, diverse performance requirements of different tasks, and the lack of real-time support from existing DL frameworks. In this paper, we present RT-mDL, a novel framework to support mixed real-time DL tasks on edge platform with heterogeneous CPU and GPU resource. 
  RT-mDL aims to optimize the mixed DL task execution to meet their diverse real-time/accuracy requirements by exploiting unique compute characteristics of DL tasks. RT-mDL employs a novel storage-bounded model scaling method to generate a series of model variants, and systematically optimizes the DL task execution by joint model variants selection and task priority assignment. To improve the CPU/GPU utilization of mixed DL tasks, RT-mDL also includes a new priority-based scheduler which employs a GPU packing mechanism and executes the CPU/GPU tasks independently.
  Our implementation on an F1/10 autonomous driving testbed shows that, RT-mDL can enable multiple concurrent DL tasks to achieve satisfactory real-time performance in traffic light detection and sign recognition. Moreover, compared to state-of-the-art baselines, RT-mDL can reduce deadline missing rate by 40.12\% while only sacrificing 1.7\% model accuracy.

  To explore the potential of infrastructure-assisted autonomous driving, this paper presents the design and deployment of Soar,

  Soar consists of both software and hardware components carefully designed to overcome various system and physical challenges. Soar can leverage the existing operational infrastructure like street lampposts for a lower barrier of adoption. Soar adopts a new communication architecture that comprises a bi-directional multi-hop I2I network and a downlink I2V broadcast service, which are designed based on off-the-shelf 802.11ac interfaces in an integrated manner. 
  Soar also features a hierarchical DL task management framework to achieve desirable load balancing among nodes and enable them to collaborate efficiently to run multiple data-intensive autonomous driving applications. We deployed a total of 18 Soar nodes on existing lampposts on campus, which have been operational for over two years. Our real-world evaluation shows that Soar can support a diverse set of autonomous driving applications and achieve desirable real-time performance and high communication reliability.

  author={Chen, Guojun and Yu, Xiaojing and Ling, Neiwen and Zhong, Lin},
  abstract={Recent advancements in robot control using large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential, primarily due to LLMsâ€™ capabilities to understand natural language commands and generate executable plans in various
  languages. However, in real-time and interactive applications involving mobile robots, particularly drones, the sequential token generation process inherent to LLMs introduces substantial latency, i.e. response time, in control plan generation.
  In this paper, we present a system called TypeFly that tackles this problem using a combination of a novel programming language called MiniSpec and its runtime to reduce the plan generation time and drone response time. That is, instead of asking an LLM to write a program (robotic plan) in the popular but verbose Python, TypeFly gets it to do it in MiniSpec specially designed for token efficiency and stream interpretation. 
  Using a set of challenging drone tasks, we show that design choices made by TypeFly can reduce up to 62% response time and provide a more consistent user experience, enabling responsive and intelligent LLM-based drone control with efficient completion.},

In this paper, we propose CoEdge, a novel cooperative edge system that can support concurrent data/compute-intensive deep learning (DL) models for distributed real-time applications such as city-scale traffic monitoring and autonomous driving. First, CoEdge includes a hierarchical DL task scheduling framework that dispatches DL tasks to edge
  nodes based on their computational profiles, communication overhead, and real-time requirements. Second, CoEdge can dramatically increase the execution efficiency of DL models by batching sensor data and aggregating the inferences of the same model. Finally, we propose a new edge containerization approach that enables an edge node to execute concurrent DL tasks by partitioning the CPU and GPU workloads into different containers. We extensively evaluate CoEdge on a self-deployed smart lamppost testbed on a university campus. 
  Our results show that CoEdge can achieve up to 82.32% reduction on deadline missing rate compared to baselines.},

  Therefore, we propose Miriam, a contention-aware task coordination framework for multi-DNN inference on edge GPU. Miriam consolidates two main components, an elastic-kernel generator, and a runtime dynamic kernel coordinator, to support mixed critical DNN inference. 
  To evaluate Miriam, we build a new DNN inference benchmark based on CUDA with diverse representative DNN workloads. Experiments on two edge GPU platforms show that Miriam can increase system throughput by 92% while only incurring less than 10% latency overhead for critical tasks, compared to state of art baselines.},

  In this paper, we propose EdgeFM, a novel edge-cloud cooperative system with open-set recognition capability. EdgeFM selectively uploads unlabeled data to query the FM on the cloud and customizes the specific knowledge and architectures for edge models. Meanwhile, EdgeFM conducts dynamic model switching at run-time taking into account both data uncertainty and dynamic network variations, which ensures the accuracy always close to the original FM. 
  We implement EdgeFM using two FMs on two edge platforms. We evaluate EdgeFM on three public datasets and two self-collected datasets. Results show that EdgeFM can reduce the end-to-end latency up to 3.2x and achieve 34.3% accuracy increase compared with the baseline.},

Most multi-modal learning approaches need to access usersâ€™ raw data, which poses significant concerns to usersâ€™ privacy. Federated learning (FL) provides a privacy-aware distributed learning framework. 
  However, current FL approaches have not addressed the unique challenges of heterogeneous multi-modal FL systems, such as modality heterogeneity and significantly longer training delay. 
  In this paper, we propose Harmony, a new system for heterogeneous multi-modal federated learning. Harmony disentangles the multimodal network training in a novel two-stage framework, namely modality-wise federated learning and federated fusion learning. 
  By integrating a novel balance-aware resource allocation mechanism in modality-wise FL and exploiting modality biases in federated fusion learning, Harmony improves the model accuracy under noni.i.d. data distributions and speeds up system convergence. 
  We implemented Harmony on a real-world multi-modal sensor testbed deployed in the homes of 16 elderly subjects for Alzheimerâ€™s Disease monitoring.

  abstract={Fusion of multiple sensor modalities, such as camera, Lidar and Radar, are commonly used in autonomous driving systems to fully utilize the complementary advantages of different sensors. 
  Surround Radar/Lidar can provide 360-degree view sampling with the minimal cost, which are promising sensing hardware solutions for autonomous driving systems. However, due to the intrinsic physical constraints, the rotating speed (i.e., the frequency to generate data frames) of surround Radar is much lower than surround Lidar, and existing Radar/Lidar fusion methods have to work at the low frequency of surround Radar, which cannot meet the high responsiveness requirement of autonomous driving systems. 
  This paper develops techniques to fuse surround Radar/Lidar with working frequency only limited by the faster surround Lidar instead of the slower surround Radar, based on the state-of-the-art Radar/Lidar DNN model MVDNet. 
  The basic idea of our approach is simple: we let MVDNet work with temporally unaligned data from Radar/Lidar, so that fusion can take place at any time when a new Lidar data frame arrives, instead of waiting for the slow Radar data frame. 
  However, directly applying MVDNet to temporally unaligned Radar/Lidar data greatly degrades its object detection accuracy. 
  The key information revealed in this paper is that we can achieve high output frequency with little accuracy loss by enhancing the training procedure to explore the temporal redundancy in fusion procedure of MVDNet so that it can tolerate the temporal unalignment of the input data. 
  We explore several different ways of training enhancement and compare them quantitatively with experiments.}
